# 📊 Statistics Basics – Key Terminologies & Foundations

This repository contains structured notes on **fundamental statistical concepts** learned from introductory statistics lectures. These concepts form the foundation for **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis**.

# 📌 Core Terminologies

## 1️⃣ Data

**Definition:**
Data are raw facts, observations, or measurements collected for analysis.

**Examples:**

- Heights of students
- Colors of cars
- Marks scored in an exam

---

## 2️⃣ Statistics

**Definition:**
Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

**Examples:**

- Calculating average marks of a class
- Finding the percentage of voters supporting a candidate

---

## 3️⃣ Population

**Definition:**
A population is the entire group of individuals or items we want to study.

**Examples:**

- All students in a university
- All customers of Amazon
- All cars manufactured in 2025

---

## 4️⃣ Sample

**Definition:**
A sample is a smaller subset taken from the population to represent it.

**Examples:**

- 200 students selected from a university
- 1,000 customers selected for a survey

---

## 5️⃣ Census

**Definition:**
A census is when data is collected from every member of the population.

**Examples:**

- National population census
- Surveying every employee in a company

---

# 📂 Parameter vs Statistic

## 6️⃣ Population Parameter (P.P)

**Definition:**
A parameter is a numerical value that describes a population.

**Examples:**

- True average height of all students
- Exact percentage of voters supporting a candidate

> Often represented by Greek symbols (μ, σ, etc.)

---

## 7️⃣ Sample Statistic (S.S)

**Definition:**
A statistic is a numerical value calculated from a sample.

**Examples:**

- Average height of 200 selected students
- Sample proportion from a survey

> Sample statistics are used to estimate population parameters.

---

# 📊 Types of Data

## 8️⃣ Qualitative (Categorical) Data

**Definition:**
Data that describe qualities or categories.

**Examples:**

- Gender
- Car color
- Marital status

> Cannot be meaningfully averaged.

---

## 9️⃣ Quantitative (Numerical) Data

**Definition:**
Data that represent numerical values or quantities.

**Examples:**

- Age
- Height
- Salary
- Number of siblings

> Can be used in mathematical calculations.

---

# 📈 Types of Quantitative Data

## 🔟 Discrete Data

**Definition:**
Countable numerical values (usually whole numbers).

**Examples:**

- Number of students
- Number of cars
- Number of children

> Cannot have fractions.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Continuous Data

**Definition:**
Numerical values that can take any value within a range (including decimals).

**Examples:**

- Height (170.5 cm)
- Weight (65.8 kg)
- Time (2.37 seconds)

> Measured, not counted.

---

# 📏 Four Levels of Measurement

## 1️⃣ Nominal Level

**Definition:**
Categorical data with no inherent order.

**Examples:**

- Blood group
- Car brands
- Gender

---

## 2️⃣ Ordinal Level

**Definition:**
Categorical data with meaningful order, but unequal intervals.

**Examples:**

- Class rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Satisfaction level (Low, Medium, High)
- Education level

---

## 3️⃣ Interval Level

**Definition:**
Numerical data with equal intervals but no true zero.

**Examples:**

- Temperature in Celsius
- IQ scores

> Zero does not mean absence.

---

## 4️⃣ Ratio Level

**Definition:**
Numerical data with equal intervals and a true zero.

**Examples:**

- Height
- Weight
- Age
- Income

> Ratios are meaningful (20 kg is twice 10 kg).
